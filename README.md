# Eruda-On-All-Sites
Client proxy(?) which patches links up so it will still use Eruda on the linked site and allows the user to visit any site with Eruda(https://github.com/liriliri/eruda) enabled.
#### Note: index.js and original interception of html and other items in the html are now deprecated, and as such, are left as references.
